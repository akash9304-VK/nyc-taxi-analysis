# NYC Taxi Data Analysis

### Analysis of Trip Patterns, Fares, and Zones in NYC  
*Using PySpark, SQL, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib*

---

## 📌 Project Objective
- Analyze **NYC taxi trips** to uncover patterns by hour, day of the week, and pickup zones.  
- Perform **data cleaning and feature engineering** for accurate insights.  
- Visualize trends in **average fare, trip duration, speed**, and **busiest zones**.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for **driver allocation, pricing strategies, and traffic optimization**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Data Processing & Analysis:** PySpark, SQL, Python, Pandas  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib (dual-axis charts)  
- **Data Format:** Parquet  

---

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers  
   - Create new features: trip duration, speed, fare per mile  
   - Extract time features: pickup hour, day, month, weekday  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Busiest pickup hours  
   - Average fare trends  
   - Trip distribution by zones  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Dual-axis charts for trips vs average fare  
   - Zone-level analysis with bar plots and heatmaps
